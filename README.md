# AS Cloud Docs
This is a website with Administrative Systems' standards and recommendations for AWS.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome! This site is mostly just markdown files, so it's easy to modify & preview right on GitHub. The site is built on [VuePress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/).

The fastest way to contribute is by clicking the 'Edit Page' link at the bottom of a page. This will bring you directly to GitHub with an editor open.

For more involved changes, you can run a local copy of the website. You will need node and yarn:

```sh
yarn install
yarn run docs:dev
```
