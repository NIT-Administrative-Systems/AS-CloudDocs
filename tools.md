While you may opt to use different tools, the EACD team will not be able to support them.

The Eclipse Git plugin is specifically **not recommended**. Issues (both technical & UI) have been observed with some versions of this plugin. All developers are encouraged to make use of the standalone [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). The Github Desktop client integrates closely with key GitHub features like pull requests & branch protection.
