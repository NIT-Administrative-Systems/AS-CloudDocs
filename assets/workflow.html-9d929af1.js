You can link to this article to avoid duplication, but each repository should indicate to developers what workflow should be used.</p><p>This documentation should be somewhere prominent, where somebody brand-new can find it: either in the repository&#39;s <code>README.md</code> file, or in project onboarding materials.</p></div><h2 id="suggested-application-workflow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#suggested-application-workflow" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Suggested Application Workflow</h2><p>This workflow is suggested for applications deployed to a development, QA, and production environment.
