It still behaves exactly like a normal Postgres/MySQL database.</p><p>For most of our use-cases, there are very few downsides to choosing Aurora RDS over traditional RDS:</p><ul><li>You cannot customize the DB config to the same degree as a traditional RDS database</li><li>Instead of choosing your EC2 instances, you allocate capacity units, which are more difficult to predict when budgeting/cost forecasting</li></ul><p>The upsides are compelling:</p><ul><li>No developer involvement in maintenance</li><li>No developer involvement in scaling (beyond setting a minimum/maximum)</li><li>DBs that are not being used can be configured to scale down to 0 capacity units</li></ul><p>There seems to be only one major downside:</p><ul><li>Serverless does not support backing up to, or restoring from, S3 buckets.</li></ul><h3 id="backups-and-security" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#backups-and-security" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Backups and Security</h3><p>Aurora Serverless comes with more safety features out of the box than RDS, with 6 data copies spread across 3 availability zones (AZ) and automatic backups to an S3 bucket. If an AZ goes down, Aurora will automatically recreate the database instance in another zone. Snapshots sent to the S3 are stored in Parquet format. Data can be recovered from this S3 bucket through creating a new Aurora cluster. Aurora also has faster replication than RDS and more replicas, 15, compared to RDS&#39;s 5. Both Aurora and RDS have failover, but due to Aurora&#39;s read replicas no last minute data is lost with Aurora while RDS may incur some data loss.</p><p>By default, Aurora does not enable performance insights and monitoring. Default backup retentions (point-in-time recovery) for RDS instances under Aurora is 7 days (1 day backup retention is free).</p><p>RDS databases within an Aurora cluster can have Deletion Protection enabled, preventing the database from being deleted accidentally. To delete the database, the Aurora cluster itself must be modified and Deletion Prevention turned off.</p><h3 id="traditional-vs-serverless" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#traditional-vs-serverless" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Traditional vs. Serverless</h3><p>Amazon recommends the <code>db.m5.large</code> instance type for a dev/QA RDS. Ignoring storage, this is ~$83/m for compute. You would ideally want two compute instances in QA/prod to avoid as much downtime as possible in your application, bringing the total for dev/qa/prod up to ~$420/month.</p><p>You can use smaller compute notes for RDS, like a <code>db.t3.medium</code>. If you were to use these for dev/QA and keep the <code>db.m5.large</code> for production, your compute costs would be around $278.44/m.</p><p>The minimum capacity units for a postgres RDS Aurora Serverless DB is two, which will cost ~$87/month if run non-stop. You should be able to configure your dev/QA environments to stop when idle, costing nothing outside of business hours. With production being the only always-on environment, the total for dev/qa/prod should be $174/month.</p><p>Both traditional and serverless RDS have an HTTP endpoint that can be enabled to allow web services to interface with your database/cluster. This can be used to run SQL statements without managing connections as well as integrate with other AWS services (e.g. Lambda) without needing to configure the service within the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) as your database/cluster.</p><h3 id="summary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Summary</h3><p>To summarize, the AS recommendations for RDS are:</p><ul><li>Use this anywhere you&#39;d use a relational DB</li><li>RDS Aurora Serverless should be used unless you need additional control over your DB</li><li>Configure your Aurora Serverless RDS clusters to sleep when they are inactive &amp; verify that is happening</li><li>Enable automated backups &amp; set an appropriate retention period</li></ul><h3 id="aurora-serverless-maintenance-policy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aurora-serverless-maintenance-policy" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Aurora Serverless Maintenance Policy</h3><p>When spinning up an Aurora serverless RDS cluster, be aware of the following limitations.
