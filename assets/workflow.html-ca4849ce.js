PRs should be viewed as a conversation between developers. They are an opportunity for communicating information about a feature with fellow developers as well as a mechanism for gathering feedback and approval for those changes. A PR could include the following:</p><ul><li>Description of the intended work</li><li>List Code/configuration files changed</li><li>Results of tests</li><li>Feedback from reviewers</li><li>etc Once a PR is approved it can be merged into the target branch and the feature branch can be closed.</li></ul><h3 id="pr-workflow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pr-workflow" aria-hidden="true">#</a> PR Workflow</h3><ul><li><p>Developer : The developer of a feature should create a <em>draft</em> pull request when they start development on a new feature. They should add a description of what they plan to accomplish and a high-level description of their approach. As a courtesy, if possible, this is also a good time to add reviewers. Once the work is <em><strong>complete and tested</strong></em> the developer should click the <strong>Ready for review</strong> option.</p></li><li><p>Reviewer : Is responsible for evaluating the committed changes. Specifically they should look for:</p><ul><li>Logical or Syntatical Errors (likely edge cases as the code should have been tested)</li><li>Standards and best practices maintained</li><li>No secrets or other sensitive information exposed</li><li>Documentation</li><li>Error handling</li><li>Does the code produce the expected as described in the draft PR</li></ul></li><li><p>Developer &amp; Reviewer : If no issues are found the reviewer will approve the pull request. At this point the developer should merge their changes and close the feature branch. If the reviewer believes changes are required or has questions for the developer the reviewer should leave comments for the developer. The developer and reviewer should work together to resolve the reviewers concerns. If rework is needed, once it is complete the developer should click the Re-request review button on the PR to signal to the reviewer the re-work is ready for review.</p></li></ul><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="Workflow Diagram"></p><h3 id="scenarios" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scenarios" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scenarios</h3><ul><li>My PR has been approved, I have merged and deployed my code but it does not fix the issue.
