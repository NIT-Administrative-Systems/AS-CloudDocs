You can amend the commit to remove the secret.</p><p>If you find a secret in the repository or push one yourself, notify the relevant lead/manager -- usually your own. Inform them what the secret is for, what it can access, and who it has been exposed to.</p><p>Here are some guidelines on how severe a situation is based on the repository access. The repository will have a public/private/internal badge next to its name.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Repository Access</th><th>Severity Level</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Private</td><td>Low to Medium</td><td>Our private repositories have a fairly tight access list -- developers and perhaps some relevant analysts. These are all people who should know to behave themselves. It&#39;s not a crisis. However, verify that there aren&#39;t non-NU outside collaborators who we may have leaked the secret to.</td></tr><tr><td>Internal</td><td>Medium to Emergency</td><td>Internal repositories are available to the Northwestern enterprise, which includes non-NUIT staff, faculty, and students. Evaluate what the secret has access to; if this is something students could abuse, we have an emergency.</td></tr><tr><td>Public</td><td>High to Emergency</td><td>Public repositories are open to the whole internet, and bad actors actively scan public commits on GitHub for secrets. Assume anything leaked in a public repository will be exploited quickly. If this is an AWS/Azure/GCP/etc credential that can provision services, <strong>immediately</strong> revoke it, even if this causes an outage -- otherwise bad actors will start spinning up $expensive$ GPU EC2s to mine bitcoin.</td></tr></tbody></table>',14),l=t("strong",null,"Low",-1),p=t("strong",null,"Medium",-1),u={href:"https://www.it.northwestern.edu/about/policies/incident.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m=t("strong",null,"High",-1),y=t("strong",null,"Emergency",-1),f=o('<p>If you know how to rotate the credential, begin making preparations to do so.

A list of repositories should be provided so the integration can be authorized to use those specific repositories. Open a TeamDynamix ticket with the <code>NUIT-AS-ADO-EACD-Cloud-Services-and-Integrations</code> team to get started on set-up.</p><p>3rd party integrations with GitHub, not via the marketplace, are typically done with OAuth. We are unlikely to enable these integrations because their access is all-or-nothing, and we do not want to expose private repositories from one team to an integration used by another.
