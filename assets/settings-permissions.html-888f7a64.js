Instead, a team can be created under Partners. The team will then be added to any applicable repositories.</p><p>Outside collaborators include other Northwestern staff (outside of IT), consultants, service providers, and student workers.</p><p>Having a team for outside collaborators allows us to assign context to who they are &amp; why they should be collaborating on the repository. It also allows us to follow the same processes for outside collaborators as internal staff.</p><h3 id="reviewer-teams" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reviewer-teams" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reviewer Teams</h3><p>Upon request, the GitHub administrators will create reviewer teams. These teams are intended to be used to easily tag a whole group of interested parties as pull request reviewers.</p><p>To reduce the burden of maintaining team memberships on our Github admins, the ability to add/remove members from a reviewer team will be delegated to some of its team member(s). Since the membership is not centerally managed, these teams <strong>are not</strong> eligible to be collaborators on a repository.</p><p>A reviewer team is a good way to sub-divide a larger group of developers by interest. For example, the EACD team covers some 15 developers. Creating an alumni-reviewers team would be an easy way to tag the six developers who actively work on alumni software.</p><h2 id="branch-protection" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#branch-protection" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Branch Protection</h2><p>For a typical Northwestern application, you will have at least three environments: development, QA/UAT/test, and production.
